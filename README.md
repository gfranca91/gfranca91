I am a **Full-Stack Developer** passionate about problem-solving, with a solid foundation in **Mechanical Engineering** and a decade of experience in leadership and discipline as a **Navy** veteran.

My unique journey has taught me to merge the analytical and structured reasoning of engineering with the creativity of software development to build robust, efficient, and high-quality solutions. After a career dedicated to planning and executing missions, my mission now is to build impactful technology.
